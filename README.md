2. The main character, Thunder Knight, has been replaced with the reference image I provided, and his weapon is the scepter from that reference. Don't make any modifications! This is a game full of power and excitement. The main character, Thunder Knight, wears black armor with golden lightning patterns that gleam in the lightning. He wears a helmet decorated with horns and a lightning-shaped ornament. He rides a warhorse that glows with lightning, its eyes gleaming blue. The skill "Thunder Blast" allows him to charge at enemies on his steed, unleashing a powerful thunderbolt. "Lightning Chain Strike" unleashes a chain of lightning from his axe, striking multiple enemies. The Lightning Wasteland is a wasteland frequently struck by lightning. The ground is scorched by lightning, and the sky is covered in dark clouds, with lightning flashing from time to time. Meanwhile, a herd of Thunder Beasts, imbued with lightning energy, scurries across the wasteland. They roar and prepare to attack. A knight gallops across the wasteland, leaning forward, axe raised high. Lightning flashes around him, and the dust kicked up by his horse's hooves echoes the surrounding lightning wasteland. Rendered using the Unreal Engine 5, the game emphasizes ray tracing to enhance the quality of light and shadow. The primary color scheme is black, gold, and blue, highlighting the power of thunder. The composition uses a centered frame, placing the knight and his horse at the center of the frame, surrounded by galloping thunder beasts and lightning, enhancing the image's focus and dynamics. The aspect ratio is 2:3.
